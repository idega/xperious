The \nmountains emerged in eruptions under an Ice Age glacier cap. Askja \nitself was formed, for the most part, at the end of the Ice Age in a \nmajor ash eruption which caused the roof of the magma chamber at the \nheart of the central volcano to subside.</span>\n<span>Askja is a part of <a href=\"http://www.northiceland.is/WhattoSeeDo/ViewAttraction/vatnajokull-national-park--north-part\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Vatnajökull National Park. </a></span>\n<span>The caldera contains several volcanoes, including <b>Víti </b>(explosive <b>volcanic crater</b>).\n Water has accumulated in the crater,&nbsp; its temperature is variable - it \nis around 30°C on average. Víti is a popular bathing site, but if you \nintend taking a dip, please be aware that the sloping path is very \nslippery in wet weather.</span>\n<span>The road to Askja goes from road 1 to road 901 and onto mountain road\n F905.

As isolated as it was then, it attracts the casual half-day visitors and serious gore-tex hikers alike. Its main attractions are three. First, the bird cliffs surrounding the bay of Hornvík, are a magnet of gigantic proportions. On the eastern side of the bay the cliff reaches a height of more than 500 metres, and the birds are teeming. Second, as there are no infrastructure and the tourists few in relation to the sheer size of the area, the sense of remoteness is strong. You can hike days on end without seeing a single person. The nature is pure and the tranquillity unmatched. Third, as the area is a haven for the Arctic fox (think hunting-ban and bird-packed cliffs), the chances of spotting one are high.Most tours, especially day tours, depart from Ísafjörður.

Built in 1996, Icelander is an exact replica of the famous Gokstad<br>ship, a remarkable archaeological find of an almost completely intact Viking ship, excavated in Norway in 1882.&nbsp;<br><br>Captain Gunnar Marel Eggertsson was inspired to build a replica of this beautiful ship based on his own background as shipbuilder and sailor. He copied the original nail for nail. In the year 2000, with a grant from the Leifur Eiríksson Commission of Iceland, he sailed from Iceland to New York, a journey of 4200 nautical miles. His voyage brought world-wide attention to Leif Eirikssons and Bjarni Herjólfssons discovery of America, dated, according to the Icelandic sagas, to exactly 1000 A.D.&nbsp;<br><br>Building Icelander was an extraordinary achievement;at 23 metres long, 5.25 meters wide and with a holding capacity of 80 tons (by modern standards), it took 2 years of effort.<br>&nbsp;<br>The sail is 130 square meters and the mast is 18 meters in length.

Launched in Washington D.C. by King Hakon of Norway, and with a State Dinner at the White House, it then traveling to 6 other cities throughout North America.

When it finally arrived in New York on October 5th-where it was greeted by First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and Mayor Rudolf Guiliani--the ship had made stops at 22 harbors. In addition to the festivities with kings, queens, presidents and mayors, when the ship arrived, visitors also streamed to see it while it was docked at each location, all told about 450,000 people came on board.&nbsp;<br><br>These two fine projects, both celebrating Icelands central role in the discovery of North America 1000 years ago by the Norse Vikings, have now found a permanent home in Vikinga Aldan (Viking Wave), the central building on the Vikingaheimar grounds.
